This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: in-place modification of variables. The `bug.asm` file contains code that modifies a value directly in memory, potentially causing problems if other parts of the program depend on the original value. The solution, `bugSolution.asm`, shows how to avoid this by using registers to perform calculations before storing the result.  This is a common issue that can be difficult to debug, as it depends entirely on how the rest of the program is written and how the memory is managed.
